# Meriat Machine Learning Notes

Documentation containing the notes, observations, and learnings during my arduous task of studying **Machine Learning**...

I intend to group all the content produced in this repository logically. Much here is the result of exercises from books and courses taken during my studies. **`All material is referenced to its source`**.

As a **Machine Learning Engineer**, I cannot fail to point out, with some importance, the reading of materials on **Cloud Computing**. It may not seem like the focus of this material, but the importance of this technology to the universe of artificial intelligence is something that should be noted...

> Depending on your company, mission, and budget, the biggest limitation is usually cost: powerful hardware and smart people donâ€™t come cheap. But it seems a few companies are moving to eliminate the infrastructure part of the equation. Cloud computing has already permeated every facet of online activity. However, recent developments in AI and the increasing sophistication of programmers, presages a new age of cloud computing.
