    "# Learning to Classify Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting patterns is a central part of Natural Language Processing. Words ending in -ed tend to be past tense verbs (5.). Frequent use of will is indicative of news text (3). These observable patterns — word structure and word frequency — happen to correlate with particular aspects of meaning, such as tense and topic. But how did we know where to start looking, which aspects of form to associate with which aspects of meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we identify particular features of language data that are salient for classifying it?\n",
    "2. How can we construct models of language that can be used to perform language processing tasks automatically?\n",
    "3. What can we learn about language from these models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way we will study some important machine learning techniques, including decision trees, naive Bayes' classifiers, and maximum entropy classifiers. We will gloss over the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of these techniques, focusing instead on how and when to use them (see the Further Readings section for more technical background). Before looking at these methods, we first need to appreciate the broad scope of this topic.\n",

    "### Supervised Classification\n",
    "Classification is the task of choosing the correct class label for a given input. In basic classification tasks, each input is considered in isolation from all other inputs, and the set of labels is defined in advance. Some examples of classification tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deciding whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "* Deciding what the topic of a news article is, from a fixed list of topic areas such as \"sports,\" \"technology,\" and \"politics.\"\n",
    "* Deciding whether a given occurrence of the word bank is used to refer to a river bank, a financial institution, the act of tilting to the side, or the act of depositing something in a financial institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic classification task has a number of interesting variants. For example, in multi-class classification, each instance may be assigned multiple labels; in open-class classification, the set of labels is not defined in advance; and in sequence classification, a list of inputs are jointly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier is called supervised if it is built based on training corpora containing the correct label for each input. The framework used by supervised classification is shown in 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![tp](http://www.nltk.org/images/supervised-classification.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Figure 1.1: Supervised Classification. (a) During training, a feature extractor is used to convert each input value to a feature set. These feature sets, which capture the basic information about each input that should be used to classify it, are discussed in the next section. Pairs of feature sets and labels are fed into the machine learning algorithm to generate a model. (b) During prediction, the same feature extractor is used to convert unseen inputs to feature sets. These feature sets are then fed into the model, which generates predicted labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will look at how classifiers can be employed to solve a wide variety of tasks. Our discussion is not intended to be comprehensive, but to give a representative sample of tasks that can be performed with the help of text classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gender Identification\n",
    "In 4 we saw that male and female names have some distinctive characteristics. Names ending in a, e and i are likely to be female, while names ending in k, o, r, s and t are likely to be male. Let's build a classifier to model these differences more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in creating a classifier is deciding what features of the input are relevant, and how to encode those features. For this example, we'll start by just looking at the final letter of a given name. The following feature extractor function builds a dictionary containing relevant information about a given name:"

    "### Choosing The Right Features\n",
    "Selecting relevant features and deciding how to encode them for a learning method can have an enormous impact on the learning method's ability to extract a good model. Much of the interesting work in building a classifier is deciding what features might be relevant, and how we can represent them. Although it's often possible to get decent performance by using a fairly simple and obvious set of features, there are usually significant gains to be had by using carefully constructed features based on a thorough understanding of the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, feature extractors are built through a process of trial-and-error, guided by intuitions about what information is relevant to the problem. It's common to start with a \"kitchen sink\" approach, including all the features that you can think of, and then checking to see which features actually are helpful.
