    "# Categorizing and Tagging Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in elementary school you learnt the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These \"word classes\" are not just the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many language processing tasks. As we will see, they arise from simple analysis of the distribution of words in text. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing?\n",
    "2. What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?\n",
    "3. How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation. These techniques are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which to present them. We will also see how tagging is the second step in the typical NLP pipeline, following tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of classifying words into their parts of speech and labeling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech tagging, POS-tagging, or simply tagging. Parts of speech are also known as word classes or lexical categories. The collection of tags used for a particular task is known as a tagset. Our emphasis in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-Using a Tagger\n",
    "A part-of-speech tagger, or POS-tagger, processes a sequence of words, and attaches a part of speech tag to each word (don't forget to import nltk):"

E.g. refUSE is a verb meaning \"deny,\" while REFuse is a noun meaning \"trash\" (i.e. they are not homophones). Thus, we need to know which word is being used in order to pronounce the text correctly. (For this reason, text-to-speech systems usually perform POS-tagging.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your Turn: Many words, like ski and race, can be used as nouns or verbs with no difference in pronunciation. Can you think of others? Hint: think of a commonplace object and try to put the word to before it to see if it can also be a verb, or think of an action and try to put the before it to see if it can also be a noun. Now make up a sentence with both uses of this word, and run the POS-tagger on this sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexical categories like \"noun\" and part-of-speech tags like NN seem to have their uses, but the details will be obscure to many readers. You might wonder what justification there is for introducing this extra level of information. Many of these categories arise from superficial analysis the distribution of words in text. Consider the following analysis involving woman (a noun), bought (a verb), over (a preposition), and the (a determiner). The text.similar() method takes a word w, finds all contexts w1w w2, then finds all words w' that appear in the same context, i.e. w1w'w2."

English adjectives can have internal structure (e.g. fall+ing in the falling stocks). Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place or direction of the event described by the verb (e.g. quickly in the stocks fell quickly). Adverbs may also modify adjectives (e.g. really in Mary's teacher was really nice).\n",

In addition, most of the tags have suffix modifiers: -NC for citations, -HL for words in headlines and -TL for titles (a feature of Brown tabs)."

    "We evaluate the performance of a tagger relative to the tags a human expert would assign. Since we don't usually have access to an expert and impartial human judge, we make do instead with gold standard test data. This is a corpus which has been manually annotated and which is accepted as a standard against which the guesses of an automatic system are assessed. The tagger is regarded as being correct if the tag it guesses for a given word is the same as the gold standard tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the humans who designed and carried out the original gold standard annotation were only human. Further analysis might show mistakes in the gold standard, or may eventually lead to a revised tagset and more elaborate guidelines. Nevertheless, the gold standard is by definition \"correct\" as far as the evaluation of an automatic tagger is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Developing an annotated corpus is a major undertaking. Apart from the data, it generates sophisticated tools, documentation, and practices for ensuring high quality annotation. The tagsets and other coding schemes inevitably depend on some theoretical position that is not shared by all, however corpus creators often go to great lengths to make their work as theory-neutral as possible in order to maximize the usefulness of their work. We will discuss the challenges of creating a corpus in 11..\n",

For example, it will assign the tag JJ to any occurrence of the word frequent, since frequent is used as an adjective (e.g. a frequent word) more often than it is used as a verb (e.g. I frequent this cafe). A unigram tagger behaves just like a lookup tagger (4), except there is a more convenient technique for setting it up, called training.

This means we would tag a word such as wind with the same tag, regardless of whether it appears in the context the wind or to wind.\n",

The tag to be chosen, tn, is circled, and the context is shaded in grey. In the example of an n-gram tagger shown in 5.1, we have n=3; that is, we consider the tags of the two preceding words in addition to the current word. An n-gram tagger picks the tag that is most likely in the given context.\n",
