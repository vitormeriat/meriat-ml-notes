    "# Categorizing and Tagging Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in elementary school you learnt the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These \"word classes\" are not just the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many language processing tasks. As we will see, they arise from simple analysis of the distribution of words in text. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing?\n",
    "2. What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?\n",
    "3. How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation. These techniques are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which to present them. We will also see how tagging is the second step in the typical NLP pipeline, following tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of classifying words into their parts of speech and labeling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech tagging, POS-tagging, or simply tagging. Parts of speech are also known as word classes or lexical categories. The collection of tags used for a particular task is known as a tagset. Our emphasis in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-Using a Tagger\n",
    "A part-of-speech tagger, or POS-tagger, processes a sequence of words, and attaches a part of speech tag to each word (don't forget to import nltk):"

    "Notice that refuse and permit both appear as a present tense verb (VBP) and a noun (NN). E.g. refUSE is a verb meaning \"deny,\" while REFuse is a noun meaning \"trash\" (i.e. they are not homophones). Thus, we need to know which word is being used in order to pronounce the text correctly. (For this reason, text-to-speech systems usually perform POS-tagging.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your Turn: Many words, like ski and race, can be used as nouns or verbs with no difference in pronunciation. Can you think of others? Hint: think of a commonplace object and try to put the word to before it to see if it can also be a verb, or think of an action and try to put the before it to see if it can also be a noun. Now make up a sentence with both uses of this word, and run the POS-tagger on this sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexical categories like \"noun\" and part-of-speech tags like NN seem to have their uses, but the details will be obscure to many readers. You might wonder what justification there is for introducing this extra level of information. Many of these categories arise from superficial analysis the distribution of words in text. Consider the following analysis involving woman (a noun), bought (a verb), over (a preposition), and the (a determiner). The text.similar() method takes a word w, finds all contexts w1w w2, then finds all words w' that appear in the same context, i.e. w1w'w2."
